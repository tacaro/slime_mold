# Slime Mold Model
## Summary
Slime molds are a group of protist species that can live freely as unicellular organisms or aggregate to form multicellular structures. Most slime molds spend the majority of their life cycle in their single-cell state. When nutrient limited, cells of a single species can congregate as a single cohesive unit. The molds can adapt their shape, size, and function. When acting in a multicellular fashion, slime molds can release spores into the air. Slime molds are heterotrophs and graze on smaller microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. These organisms use cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a messaging molecule. Within an aggregate, modulation of cAMP leads to a complex array of behavior. The unique “bottom-up” self-organizing behavior of slime molds is interesting as a study of decentralized control systems. Similar to stigmergy in insects, there is no central controller of slime mold action e.g. ant foraging, honeybee swarm modulation, etc. While the individual agents in the insect models are obligated to community lifestyle, slime molds spend a minority of their time [if any] as a superorganism: individual protists are ultimately self-sufficient.
